# Mr. E's Python Guide

## About:
Mr. Enrico is not a programmer, but he feels that all of his students should
 learn to code at least a little. This is his feeble attempt at making that
 process a touch simpler.

 For what it's worth, he learned Python through [Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com) in
 much the same way he's asking you to.

 The guide assumes Python 3.x

## Installation:<a name="installation"></a>
Download or clone the repository into a directory that works for you. The
notes are written in Jupyter Notebook format, so you may need to `pip
install jupyter notebook` if you want to play with the notebooks locally, or
 head over to [nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/denriconbhs/python_guide/tree/master/)
 to follow along from the web.

 Once you've downloaded the requisite files, you're ready to (hopefully)
 start learning! For the exercises, you'll do your work in the `exercise.py`
  file, and run `test.py` to see if it worked. This may change in the
  future, so keep an eye on this doc if things don't seem to be working out
  for you.
