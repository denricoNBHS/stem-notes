    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- the function has two _positional_ __parameters__, `a` and `b`. This means `a` and `b` are assigned _in order_. It may help to think of parameters as placeholders for values that are taken as input when the function is called. \n",

    "\n",
    "- a colon `:` and a newline take us to the body of the function. Notice after the newline we have an indented block. This block defines the _internal_ workings of the function, and effectively acts as a lockbox, preventing anything outside the function from seeing the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- there's another keyword, `return` that tells Python what information to pass outside of the code block. `return` passes the information on to whichever process called the function. So for example if we run: `type(add_squares(1,2))`, the interpreter will first evaluate `add_squares(1,2)` and then pass that answer along to the `type()` function, which should spit out `int`. "
